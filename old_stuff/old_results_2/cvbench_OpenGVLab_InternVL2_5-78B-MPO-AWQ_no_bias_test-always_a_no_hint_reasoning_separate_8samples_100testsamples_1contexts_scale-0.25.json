The desk is positioned further back, near the center of the image.\n\n2. **Perspective**: The table appears larger and more detailed, indicating it is closer to the camera. The desk appears smaller and less detailed, suggesting it is farther away.\n\n3. **Depth Cues**: The table is in front of the desk, which is a clear depth cue indicating that the table is closer to the camera.\n\nBased on these observations, the table is closer to the camera.\n\nThe answer is (A)."
