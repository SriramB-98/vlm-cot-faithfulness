It is positioned close to the camera, as it is in the foreground.\n\n2. **Position of the Desk**: The desk is located further back in the room, near the center of the image. It is positioned behind the pillow and closer to the back wall.\n\n3. **Depth Perception**: The perspective of the image shows that objects closer to the camera appear larger and more detailed, while objects further away appear smaller and less detailed. The pillow appears larger and more detailed compared to the desk, indicating it is closer to the camera.\n\nBased on this analysis, the pillow is closer to the camera than the desk.\n\nThe answer is (A)."
