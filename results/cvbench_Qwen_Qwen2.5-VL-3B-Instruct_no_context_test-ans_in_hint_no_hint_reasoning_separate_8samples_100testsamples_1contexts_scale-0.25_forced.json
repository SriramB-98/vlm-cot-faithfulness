This principle is known as the perspective effect.\n\nGiven that the books are inside the bookcase, they are likely positioned deeper in the scene relative to the bookcase itself. Therefore, the bookcase, being the outermost object, would be closer to the camera than the books inside it.\n\nThus, the correct answer is:\n\n(B) bookcase"
