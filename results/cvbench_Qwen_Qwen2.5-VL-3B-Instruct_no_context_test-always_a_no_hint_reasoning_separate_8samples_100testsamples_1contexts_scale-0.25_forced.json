Conversely, objects that are farther away appear smaller and less prominent.\n\nGiven that the door is highlighted by a red box, it suggests that the door is closer to the camera. The shelves, highlighted by a blue box, are further back in the scene.\n\nTherefore, the door is closer to the camera.\n\nAnswer: (A)"
