It is positioned directly in front of the staircase and is more centrally located in the image. The pillow, on the other hand, is on the bed, which is further back in the room.\n\n2. **Depth Cues**: The desk appears larger and more detailed, which is a common visual cue indicating it is closer to the camera. The pillow, while visible, is smaller and less detailed, suggesting it is further away.\n\n3. **Relative Size and Detail**: Objects that are closer to the camera typically appear larger and more detailed. The desk fits this description, while the pillow does not.\n\nGiven these observations, the desk is closer to the camera.\n\n(a)\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (b) desk.\nEnd of reasoning process.
